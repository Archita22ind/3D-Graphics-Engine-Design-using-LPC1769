# 3D-Graphics-Engine-Design-using-LPC1769
In this project I have designed and built a system that displays a 3D cube structure on a 2D 1.8 inches diagonal LCD TFT display (128x160 resolution, 18-bit (262,144) color). The LPC1769 uses its SPI Interface to connect with the LCD.It has the MISO, MOSI and the SCK options and therefore is used as a master to interface with a SPI Flash which forms the slave peripheral.
